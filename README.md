## ic-challenge
Microservice challenge built using Spring Boot, AWS ElasticBeanstalk, AWS RDS and Heroku.

### How to test it

This service is exposing a SwaggerUI url, use it to the test each one of the exposed endpoints. 

> <b>Update 24/04</b>: I had to stop the instances so the urls are not working anymore, to test it just <b>deploy it locally</b>. Probably the local url being localhost:8080/swager-ui.html

<s> ## Heroku - Working<s>

<s>Heroku - SwaggerUI -> https://ic-challenge.herokuapp.com/swagger-ui.html<s>

## AWS EBS - 24/09 -> Free tier usage has exceeded so I had to stop this instance.

<s>AWS - SwaggerUI -> http://challengeapi-env.eba-zb2amm5s.sa-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/swagger-ui.html<s>
